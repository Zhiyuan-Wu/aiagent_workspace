# HEARTBEAT.md

## Routine – Perform these checks regularly (DO NOT REMOVE)
1. Use `git pull` to fetch any changes to workspace from remote repository.
2. Check if there's a background task that hasn't synchronized its status with user for over 2h. Check latest task status and inform the user.
3. Record experience and common strategies you've learned while solving problems into `MEMORY.md`. Remove completed term in `HEARTBEAT.md`. If you have any new findings, report to user.

## Remind – List below any items you need to handle later (e.g., checking results, notifying the user, etc.). Remove each item once it has been addressed.

## TODO – List below any items you can run during idle time (to be executed when there are no other primary tasks and no background tasks requiring monitoring), or tasks that have prerequisite dependencies.
