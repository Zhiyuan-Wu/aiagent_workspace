## Routine – Perform these checks regularly (DO NOT REMOVE)
1. Use `git pull` to fetch any changes to workspace from remote repository.
2. Check status of all background tasks. For background Claude Code tasks, also check corresponding repository directly for result files. Report to latest progress to user if there's anything new/wrong.
3. If prerequisites of any todo items are completed, start subsequent tasks. Don't ask for permissions, just do it.
4. Stop completed or outdated background tasks. Remove unused task files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/claude_tasks`.
5. Record experience and common strategies you've learned while solving problems into `MEMORY.md`. If you have any new findings or suggestions, report to user.
