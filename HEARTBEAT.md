# HEARTBEAT.md

## Routine – Perform these checks regularly
1. Use `git pull` to fetch any changes to the workspace from the remote repository.
2. Check the "things" section in `TODO.md` for any unprocessed tasks. Execute those tasks, and after completion, add your feedback directly after the corresponding TODO item. Never delete a TODO item yourself; instead, report your execution results to the user.
3. Review the "ideas" section in `TODO.md`. These are concepts the user is considering. If you have any insights, add annotations there and briefly share your feedback with the user—be sure to appreciate their good ideas!

## Remind – List below any items you need to handle later (e.g., checking results, notifying the user, etc.). Do not include tasks that require immediate action. Remove each item once it has been addressed.
