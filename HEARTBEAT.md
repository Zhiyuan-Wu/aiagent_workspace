## Routine – Perform these checks regularly
1. Use `git pull` to fetch any changes to the workspace from the remote repository.
2. Check if there's a background task that hasn't synchronized its status with the user for over 2h. Check task status and inform the user.

## Remind – List below any items you need to handle later (e.g., checking results, notifying the user, etc.). Remove each item once it has been addressed.
